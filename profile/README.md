# Web3 Set Theory

The Web3 Set Theory schema defines a simple, but extensible interface for applying information set theory to Web3 entities.

The primary objective is to contextualize relationships between different Entity types in varying EVM compute environments using a simple off-chain set based schema to organize the who, what, when, where, how... and why.

<p>A Set is a collection of entities, conditions and rules. The entities must share similar properties and behaviors. The conditions define what "context" should be applied to entities. And finally rules relationships between entities contained within the set</p> -->
